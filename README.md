# Single Responsibility Principle
A repo that contains code example of the Single Responsibility Principle of the SOLID principle.
The first commit illustrates the lack of Single Responsibility Principle. As for the subsequent commits should illustrate the implementation of the Single Responsibility Principle by having classes that have single purpose; Studentoperations should include operations that can be exectured on the Student objects, the StudentFactory class should contain code that creates new instances of student objects.
